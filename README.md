## Game Modes

### Classic Mode (5×5)
A straightforward grid where you select numbers that add up to the target sums shown on the edges.

### Cages Mode (8×8)
An advanced mode with irregular "cages" - groups of cells with their own sum targets shown in the top-left corner of each cage.

## Rules

### Objective
Select numbers from the grid so that:
- Each **row's** selected numbers sum to the target shown on the **left edge**
- Each **column's** selected numbers sum to the target shown on the **top edge**
- In **Cages mode**: numbers within each cage must also sum to the cage's target (shown in the cage's top-left corner)

### How to Play

1. **Tap a cell** to cycle through states:
   - **Unselected** - number is visible but not counted
   - **Selected** (bordered) - number counts toward sums
   - **Crossed out** (white text) - number disappears for convenience, not counted

2. **Check your progress**: The status bar shows important information about the game

3. **Use hints**: Click "Hint" to reveal one correct cell (you have 3 hints per puzzle)

4. **Submit**: When you think all sums match their targets, tap "Submit" to check your solution

## Notes

This plugin was tested on a JailBroken kindle with KoReader 2025.10
If you find any bug or find a way to center the board (I'm new at making plugins)
make a pull request or contact me at my reddit account or send me a mail to tomasjdle@gmail.com

I'm trying to implement a sort of framework called kopuzzle
It's barebones as of now, I will make a repository for it later if 
you want to expand upon it
